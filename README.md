# qa-automation-kafka-playwright
End-to-end Quality Engineering project integrating API testing, UI testing, Kafka messaging, and CI/CD in Azure DevOps

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This is an **end-to-end Quality Engineering showcase project** built using the [RealWorld Example App](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) as the application under test.  
The goal of this project is to demonstrate my expertise in:

- **Backend API testing** (Postman / Playwright API)
- **UI automation** with Playwright + TypeScript
- **SQL & advanced data validation** using PostgreSQL
- **Message queue validation** with Apache Kafka *(planned)*
- **CI/CD pipelines** in Azure DevOps
- **Containerized deployments** with Docker & Kubernetes *(planned)*
- **ETL testing**

This project is designed to mimic a real-world enterprise QA workflow â€” from local environment setup to automated regression execution in CI/CD.
